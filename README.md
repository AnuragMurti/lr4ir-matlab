# LR4IR Research Environment in MATLAB

This project contains the basic structure of a MATLAB research environment (with auxiliary scripts in Python) for Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval (LR4IR) using the [LETOR benchmark datasets][letor] (version 2.0). Two LR4IR algorithms based on the direct optimization of the MAP measure over the training sample using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) are included as examples. You should extract the [TD2003 and TD2004 LETOR2.0 datasets][letor2.0datasets] in the corresponding directories and the [evaluation tools][letor2.0eval] (particularly `Eval-Score.pl`) in the root directory.
